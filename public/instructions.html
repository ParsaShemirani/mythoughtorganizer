  <h1>Instructions & Help</h1>
  <p>Welcome to your Thought Organizer! This application is designed to help you capture, edit, and organize your thoughts into a dynamic system that supports thought chains, grouping, and real-time filtering.</p>
  
  <h2>How to View and Edit Thoughts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Main Page:</strong> The main page (<code>index.html</code>) displays all your thoughts. Each entry shows the full text, creation date, tags, and any assigned group IDs.</li>
    <li><strong>Inline Editing:</strong> Click the "Edit" button on a thought to modify its content, tags, group IDs, and chain ID. Click "Save" to update the entry or "Cancel" to discard changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Chain View:</strong> If a thought is the beginning of a chain (i.e., it has no chainId but has replies), a "Click to view chain" link appears. Clicking that opens <code>chain.html</code> in a new tab, showing the entire thread of related thoughts.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How to Create New Entries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Create Page:</strong> Open the create page (<code>create.html</code>) to add a new thought or group. For new thoughts, you can input the thought text, tags (comma separated), optional group IDs, and an optional chain ID if it's a reply.</li>
    <li><strong>New Groups:</strong> Use the same page to create a new group by entering a group name and an optional description. Groups are stored separately and listed in the Groups page.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Filtering, Sorting, and Grouping</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Filtering:</strong> Use the search fields on the main page to filter thoughts by text, tags, and group IDs. The results update automatically as you type.</li>
    <li><strong>Date Sorting:</strong> Use the dropdown menu on the main page to sort thoughts by date in ascending or descending order, or choose "No date sort" to disable date ordering.</li>
    <li><strong>Group Filtering:</strong> Enter one or more group IDs (comma separated) to show only the thoughts belonging to those groups. The filtering uses an AND logicâ€”only thoughts with all specified group IDs will be shown.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Additional Concepts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Thought Chains:</strong> Thoughts can be linked in a chain by using the <code>chainId</code> attribute. This creates a thread where you can see the evolution of an idea over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Groups:</strong> Groups help organize thoughts by theme or topic. Use the Groups page (<code>groups.html</code>) to view a phonebook-style list of all groups with their IDs and descriptions.</li>
    <li>For bulk imports from external tools (like ChatGPT), make sure to start with the current highest ID so that new entries remain sequential.</li>
    <li>Backup your <code>data.json</code> file manually as needed.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you have any further questions, you can always refer back to this page or check the UI prompts on the main application.</p>
  
  <p>Happy organizing!</p>
