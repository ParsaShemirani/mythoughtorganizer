If someone stands in his way, he just looks the other way and keeps walking until he can. His face looks the same whether there is nothing in front of him or if he is finding his way around a person. He is most responsive to \"Mateen, high five, high five\". If he hears that during his walk, he will try his best to give the high five. But he will do that as if he's doing the walk and the high five at the same time. It's as if he never stopped what he was doing. It's as if he was just doing one thing.",
